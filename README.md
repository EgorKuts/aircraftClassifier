This repo consist of two image classifiers based on convolutional nets:

-BinaryClassifier detects presence of an aircraft on the given image. Accuracy 0.9586, FPR=0.042, FNR=0.04

-AicraftClassifier maps given image of an aircraft to one of the 70 classes(corresponding to the aircrafts' models). Accuracy: 0.7756
 
You can run these classifiers in Google colab(the instructions are provided inside the files). Some screens:
